# Backtracking-Sudoku-Solver
Through the use of the "Backtracking Algorithm" you are able to solve any Sudoku board

First create a function to sort through your sudoku board to find all empty spots

Second create a function to validate a number placement in the empty spot
   (validation must consider the row, column, and subgrid placement of the number)

Third in range of numbers 1 through 9 place a number within the empty spot
    -if valid, place the number in that empty spot
    -else try another number
