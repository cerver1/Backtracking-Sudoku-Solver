# Kotlin-SudokuSolver

### ***Solve any valid sudoku board in a matter of seconds!***

This program first traverses the sudoku board searching for any empty positions.
In this case all empty positions are marked as 0.

If an empty position(0) is found, the program attempts to fill it with a valid value (1..9)
